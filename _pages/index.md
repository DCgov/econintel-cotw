<h3>Launching a tool to explore DC data Ward by Ward</h3>

Today DMPED is launching the <a href="http://open.dc.gov/econintel-wardtool/" target="_blank">Ward Indicators Tool</a>, a section of our Economic Intelligence Dashboard that makes it easier to view DC investments and economic/demographic data specific to your Ward. We have drawn from public data sources to stitch together a picture of the diverse economic characters of DC’s 8 Wards. View DC government investment projects started or completed in your neighborhood since the beginning of 2015, including DMPED real estate redevelopment projects, Affordable Housing Production and Preservation projects, Industrial Revenue Bond projects, DHCD PADD Vacant Properties, and Great Streets Small Business Grantees. 

And play with data visualization comparisons on your neighborhood. The chart below shows the different character of housing in DC’s Wards. Only two Wards contain primarily single family (attached or detached) housing units – Wards 4 and 5 in Northwest and Northeast. On the other hand, homes in large (5+ unit) buildings predominate in Wards 1, 2, 3, and 8. Compare these metrics to the age and homeownership rate of each Ward’s population (and more!) using our Ward Tool indicators page <a href="http://open.dc.gov/econintel-wardtool/data.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
