<h3>How Single-Family Housing Prices Have Changed in DC</h3>

When housing prices in the United States fell precipitously across 2008 and 2009, many DC zip codes weathered the crisis quite well—maintaining relatively consistent single-family housing prices throughout. Using a new repeat-sales home price index (HPI) from the Federal Housing Finance Administration, we can see some city neighborhoods were affected more than others. A few have not seen prices bounce back to pre-crisis levels, while others have seen prices surge far higher than before. 
                                                                                                                    
As of 2015, numbers across many of DC’s zip codes have well surpassed a 2007 pre-crisis HPI peak. Zip codes shown in blue in the second chart below saw price decreases following the recession in 2008, but recovered in the years following. The three with the highest home-price index readings in 2015 were <b>20001</b>, <b>20002</b>, and <b>20010</b>. These zip codes cover the neighborhoods of Bloomingdale, Eckington, Ivy City, Trinidad, NoMa, Capitol Hill, and parts of Columbia Heights, Mount Pleasant, Park View, and Shaw.  

On the other hand, homes across zip codes <b>20019</b>, <b>20020</b>, and <b>20032</b> also decreased in price following the recession but have remained lower-priced compared to the peak they reached in 2007. They are the only zip codes in DC that have not exceeded pre-crisis HPI levels. These three zip codes, all of which are located east of the Anacostia River, include the neighborhoods of Benning, Capitol View, Congress Heights, Deanwood, Grant Park, and Historic Anacostia. Zip codes <b>20019</b> and <b>20032</b> represent housing prices with the lowest average increase in DC since the year 2000, according to the HPI data. 

A few zip codes in DC showed very little price volatility in the periods before and after the mortgage meltdown. These low-volatility neighborhoods include Adams Morgan, Chevy Chase, Cleveland Park, Georgetown, Palisades, and Tenleytown.

The FHFA home price index, which is not adjusted for inflation, is a weighted, repeat-sales index—which measures the price changes on the same properties. By controlling for differences in housing quality by using repeat transactions of the same home, this index provides an accurate view of how housing prices have changed, controlling for the changing characteristics of homes which have sold. FHFA’s index only includes single-family homes. It excludes condominiums, cooperatives, multi-unit properties, and planned unit developments. See the proportion of single family homes in each Ward in our dashboard <a href="http://open.dc.gov/econintel-wardtool/data.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
