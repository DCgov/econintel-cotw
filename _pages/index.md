<h3>A new index for housing market activity</h3>
 
There are a number of ways to track the health of the housing market in the US. Particularly after the housing crisis, watching for signs of housing market overheating is of keen interest for economic policymakers. We track several measures of home prices and buying/selling behavior, some of which can be seen on our Economic Intelligence Dashboard <a href="http://open.dc.gov/economic-intelligence/housing-indicators.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Many indices use public real estate transaction records or mortgage data as their source of home prices. In the most recent edition of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s <i>Cityscape</i> journal, mathematician Nikos Askitas proposes a new housing index based on Google Trends results. The BUSE index (<u>bu</u>yers <u>se</u>llers index), as described in the article <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol18num2/ch8.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, measures the ratio of home purchase interest vs. home selling interest in the US housing market based on Google search data. The BUSE index for the US housing market correlates significantly with the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller® Home Price Index, but has the key advantage of sourcing almost real-time data. The result is a “nowcast” of US home buying and selling behavior, and a leading indicator of US home prices.

Following the methodology of Askitas*, we re-created the BUSE index just for DC. In the period between 2005 – 2016, the DC BUSE index consistently shows more search interest in buying vs. selling. The same is true for the US index (see the graphic from Askitas’ paper below). However, DC’s BUSE index reaches a higher peak and a higher low than the US index. In late 2012, for example, home-buying searches outnumbered home-selling searches in DC by 3.5 to 1.

<h5>Figure from Askitas, "Trend-Spotting in the Housing Market," <i>Cityscapes</i>, 2016</h5>

This result certainly squares with DC being one of the more expensive housing markets in the country. Plus, buyer interest outweighing inventory means that homes tend to sell more quickly than in other areas. However, the DC index is not as correlated to home prices as the US index is. This is most likely because Google data measures what people are searching for <i>in DC</i>, but doesn’t capture searches by people outside DC who will eventually buy in DC. Though DC’s search data skews toward buyers, this index is probably an underestimate of the buying interest in DC. 

*With a slight tweak – we smooth the Google data using simply a 52-week moving average.
