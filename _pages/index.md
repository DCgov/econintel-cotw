<h3>Interactive DC salary data</h3>

Two weeks ago we used wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) dataset to analyze the occupations that make up DC’s <a href='http://open.dc.gov/econintel-cotw/08-2016.html' target="_blank">‘creative class’</a>. This week, <a href="http://districtmeasured.com/" target="_blank">District, Measured</a>, the blog of DC’s Office of Revenue Analysis, posted a fantastic <a href="https://districtmeasured.com/2016/08/23/d-c-s-cashiers-and-janitors-are-more-likely-to-live-in-the-city-than-other-workers-but-thats-changing/" target="_blank">investigation</a> of DC’s high, low, and middle-wage occupations, and where workers in those jobs tend to live. That analysis also used OES data as a basis for defining occupations by wage level. 

But what, specifically, are the salaries associated with specific occupations in DC? In our chart of the week, we provide an interactive tool to examine the reality of what workers in DC earn annually using the OES data. Below, you can see the distribution of DC salaries for both full-time and part-time workers, by occupation. Note that these occupations cross public and private sector lines – the phlebotomist category here includes both government phlebotomists and private sector phlebotomists.

In DC, the sectors with the widest wage distributions are management, life/physical/social sciences, and computer/mathematical occupations. The individual occupations with the widest ranges – over $100,000 separating the 25th and 75th percentile – are internists and makeup artists. Unsurprisingly, management occupations tend to have the highest median salaries, and CEOs top the field.
<br><br>
The lowest median salaries, for occupations which have annual salary data, include food prep workers and wait staff. Occupations in the food prep and serving sector have the lowest median wages, followed by personal care and service occupations. However, food prep and serving is the fourth largest occupation sector represented in DC. And the sector is growing – in 2015, 8.0% of jobs in DC were in food prep and serving, up from 6.3% in 2005. There’s been a net gain of over 15,800 jobs in the sector in that five year period, over 11,000 of which were added since 2010.  Meanwhile, as District, Measured notes, the workers in these low-wage occupations are less likely to live in DC, where they work. Most likely, this means that workers from the surrounding area are more likely to come to DC for this influx of jobs, and workers in these occupations who used to live in DC are moving out because of affordability concerns.
