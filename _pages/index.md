<h3>What's up (and down) with Labor Force Participation in the District?</h3>

The <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART/" target="_blank">Labor Force Participation Rate</a> in the US has been steadily decreasing since peaking in 2000 at over two-thirds of the adult civilian population. Today, that figure for the US as a whole is around 63%. That means about 93 million people working-age people in the US are neither working nor looking for work. The Labor Force Participation rate is a measure of who is in the labor force. It includes both those employed and those unemployed and searching for work. People out of the labor force may be out for different reasons – they may be homemakers, they could be prevented from working because of a medical condition, they may be retired, full-time students, or they may be so-called “discouraged” workers who have given up looking for a job. 
 
In DC, where we have been creating jobs at a pace of over 10,000 per year for the last several years, the Labor Force Participation rate has increased overall. More jobs available may mean lower barriers to employment for DC residents. Plus, we’ve gained population, and people moving to the District for jobs are participating in the labor force. 
 
We can look to the US Census’ American Community Survey to explore labor force participation in more detail. The chart below uses survey samples to compare two recent time periods in DC, one from 2006-2010 and another from 2010-2014. Since this is sample data, we need to take into account the margin of error when assessing whether positive or negative changes have happened. Looking by Ward, we can see that the Labor Force Participation rate has remained roughly the same or actually increased in seven of our eight Wards. Ward 7 is the clear outlier here; the proportion of Ward 7 residents in the labor force went down.

We can look a bit deeper at Ward data to see which demographic groups are driving the fluctuations. In the chart below, selecting a Ward and a Demographic Type will show data broken down by group and topic. The bars in blue and orange show the increase or decrease in Labor Force Participation Rate for each group. The skinnier the bar, the fewer people there are in the overall Ward population. The color shows how impactful that group was in driving the overall trend in the Ward.

In Ward 7, unlike other Wards in the city, males are driving the participation decrease. Males in Ward 7 dropped out of the labor force in a fashion that had a significant impact on the Ward's participation rate. In Ward 7, where the majority of the population is Black/African-American the labor force participation is decreasing among this population, which has an almost equally large impact on the rate. So we can infer that the demographic driving this change in Ward 7 is primarily Black males. The decrease is about equally spread out among different education levels. 
 
The change does not necessarily mean that people in Ward 7 are dropping out of the labor force at a high clip. It could also mean that, due to migration, Ward 7 is gaining fewer participants (e.g. full-time students), or that participants are moving elsewhere. The rate only refers to the proportion of the population as a whole within the survey time periods.
 
This is not a common trend within the rest of the city – in six of eight Wards the labor force participation rate grew or held steady for African Americans, and the same for males. In future analysis, we will explore more data to see what is driving these economic and demographic changes. Stay tuned.
