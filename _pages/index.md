<h3>Doing More with More: Putting Affordable Housing Dollars to Work</h3>

Since taking office, the Bowser Administration has invested $100 million annually into the Housing Production Trust Fund, which is one of several sources of financing for building new affordable housing and preserving existing affordable units. The Trust Fund is written into the <a href="https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/42-2802.html" target="_blank">DC Code</a>. Every year, at least half the spending (via loans, grants, and gap financing) must go toward funding affordable rental units. 40% of the spending every year must go toward units which are set aside for very low-income households, or those making at most 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Another 40% of the spending must go to units for extremely low-income households, or those that make less than 30% of AMI. You can find the income limits for FY16, by household size, posted by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il16/FY16-IL-dc.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

A <a href="http://housingtrustfundproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HTF_Survey-Report-2016-final.pdf" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the Housing Trust Fund Project, a unit of the Center for Community Change, assessed the state of housing trust funds around the country. 49 states (plus DC) have established such funds. There are also city-level funds established in 35 states, and county-level funds established in 12 states. DC’s Trust Fund stands out.

Though the report (rightly) counts DC as a state, if it were a city fund, DC’s investment accounted for over 1/5 of the total city Housing Trust Fund total invested nationwide in fiscal year 2015. Among states, DC’s $100 million investment made up over 1/8 of all state trust fund investments in fiscal year 2015. Among states, only Florida has a larger trust fund with $175 million invested in 2015.
<br><br>
Accounting for population, DC’s investment seems even more extraordinary. Comparing the housing investment in DC to the District’s population, it’s clear that we’re making a larger per-capita investment than any other state, as shown in the chart below.

The Trust Fund is a dedicated source of funds for affordable housing as DC deals with booming population growth projections and rapidly changing neighborhoods. And it’s not just the investment that matters – it’s getting the money out the door and in the hands of organizations which are on the ground producing and preserving affordability for DC residents. That’s why we’re also proud to report that fiscal year 2016 (which just ended on September 30) was the first year the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), which administers the Fund, also spent $100 million from the HPTF within one fiscal year. You can see data – updated monthly – on our pipeline of affordable housing projects in the District <a href="http://open.dc.gov/economic-intelligence/affordable-production-preservation.html" target="_blank">here</a> on DMPED’s dashboard. These projects include both HPTF-funded affordable housing, and housing which received other types of financing, like Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Federal grant funding, and land value write-downs. Other affordable housing units are produced via the Inclusionary Zoning program, which mandates a portion of all new developments (both for-sale and for-rent) in certain areas include affordable units.
