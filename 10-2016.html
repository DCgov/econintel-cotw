<h3>Doing More with More: Putting Affordable Housing Dollars to Work</h3>

Since taking office, the Bowser Administration has invested $100 million annually into the Housing Production Trust Fund, which is one of several sources of financing for building new affordable housing and preserving existing affordable units. The Trust Fund is written into the <a href="https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/42-2802.html" target="_blank">DC Code</a>. Every year, at least half the spending (via loans, grants, and gap financing) must go toward funding affordable rental units. 40% of the spending every year must go toward units which are set aside for very low-income households, or those making at most 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Another 40% of the spending must go to units for extremely low-income households, or those that make less than 30% of AMI. You can find the income limits for FY16, by household size, posted by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il16/FY16-IL-dc.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
A <a href="http://housingtrustfundproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HTF_Survey-Report-2016-final.pdf" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the Housing Trust Fund Project, a unit of the Center for Community Change, assessed the state of housing trust funds around the country. 49 states (plus DC) have established such funds. There are also city-level funds established in 35 states, and county-level funds established in 12 states. DC’s Trust Fund stands out.

Though the report (rightly) counts DC as a state, if it were a city fund, DC’s investment accounted for over 1/5 of the total city Housing Trust Fund total invested nationwide in fiscal year 2015. Among states, DC’s $100 million investment made up over 1/8 of all state trust fund investments in fiscal year 2015. Among states, only Florida has a larger trust fund with $175 million invested in 2015.
<br><br>
Accounting for population, DC’s investment seems even more extraordinary. Comparing the housing investment in DC to the District’s population, it’s clear that we’re making a larger per-capita investment than any other state, as shown in the chart below.

The Trust Fund is a dedicated source of funds for affordable housing as DC deals with booming population growth projections and rapidly changing neighborhoods. And it’s not just the investment that matters – it’s getting the money out the door and in the hands of organizations which are on the ground producing and preserving affordability for DC residents. That’s why we’re also proud to report that fiscal year 2016 (which just ended on September 30) was the first year the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), which administers the Fund, also spent $100 million from the HPTF within one fiscal year. You can see data – updated monthly – on our pipeline of affordable housing projects in the District <a href="http://open.dc.gov/economic-intelligence/affordable-production-preservation.html" target="_blank">here</a> on DMPED’s dashboard. These projects include both HPTF-funded affordable housing, and housing which received other types of financing, like Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Federal grant funding, and land value write-downs. Other affordable housing units are produced via the Inclusionary Zoning program, which mandates a portion of all new developments (both for-sale and for-rent) in certain areas include affordable units.

<h3>Income: Taking it Personal</h3>
</a>
We track DC’s Personal Income because it represents the money District residents earn whether they work in DC or elsewhere. Personal Income is hardly “personal,” though – this metric aggregates up all incomes received by all DC residents. Our GDP, on the other hand, measures the value of all goods and services produced within the District, including both residents and non-residents. Use of both figures allow us to track our economy over time and better understand where our residents make a living. Growth in our Personal Income reflects more income earned by DC residents. 
<br><br>
Personal Income represents residents’ income from all sources: from a job, from owning a home, from owning financial assets or from government benefits like Social Security. GDP, or gross domestic product, is the sum of what all consumers, businesses and government agencies spend on goods and services. DC’s GDP represents the overall strength of the economy located in DC, while Personal Income reflects the economic power of DC’s households. 
<br><br>
In DC, Personal Income has been growing at a rate faster than the US as a whole, as shown in the first chart. This is due in large part to some major population growth in DC – more people means more income. Among states, DC saw the greatest change in Personal Income between 2016 Q1 and Q2.

When we adjust for population, we can see that Per Capita Personal Income in DC is the highest in the country compared to other states – about $75,000. This is a reflection of DC’s unique position as a city and a state. Urban areas tend to have higher per-capita incomes (and higher costs of living). State metrics all include some data from rural and suburban areas, while DC’s data reflects a totally urban area. 
<br><br>
This state vs. city data effect can also be seen in the components of Personal Income. In 2016 Q2, net earnings from jobs & labor for residents in DC grew at a pace slower than 8 other states, even though as a whole DC’s Personal Income growth exceeded all states. The component of Personal Income which grew the most in DC was “transfer receipts,” which counts government benefits like retirement and disability insurance benefits (mainly Social Security), medical benefits (mainly Medicare and Medicaid), income maintenance benefits, unemployment insurance compensation, veterans’ benefits, and federal education and training assistance. The rate of growth of transfer receipts in DC was more in line with US metropolitan areas in the US, and less similar to the rates of growth in areas that are rural or suburban.
