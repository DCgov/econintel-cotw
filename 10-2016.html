<h3>Income: Taking it Personal</h3>
</a>
We track DC’s Personal Income because it represents the money District residents earn whether they work in DC or elsewhere. Personal Income is hardly “personal,” though – this metric aggregates up all incomes received by all DC residents. Our GDP, on the other hand, measures the value of all goods and services produced within the District, including both residents and non-residents. Use of both figures allow us to track our economy over time and better understand where our residents make a living. Growth in our Personal Income reflects more income earned by DC residents. 
<br><br>
Personal Income represents residents’ income from all sources: from a job, from owning a home, from owning financial assets or from government benefits like Social Security. GDP, or gross domestic product, is the sum of what all consumers, businesses and government agencies spend on goods and services. DC’s GDP represents the overall strength of the economy located in DC, while Personal Income reflects the economic power of DC’s households. 
<br><br>
In DC, Personal Income has been growing at a rate faster than the US as a whole, as shown in the first chart. This is due in large part to some major population growth in DC – more people means more income. Among states, DC saw the greatest change in Personal Income between 2016 Q1 and Q2.

When we adjust for population, we can see that Per Capita Personal Income in DC is the highest in the country compared to other states – about $75,000. This is a reflection of DC’s unique position as a city and a state. Urban areas tend to have higher per-capita incomes (and higher costs of living). State metrics all include some data from rural and suburban areas, while DC’s data reflects a totally urban area. 
<br><br>
This state vs. city data effect can also be seen in the components of Personal Income. In 2016 Q2, net earnings from jobs & labor for residents in DC grew at a pace slower than 8 other states, even though as a whole DC’s Personal Income growth exceeded all states. The component of Personal Income which grew the most in DC was “transfer receipts,” which counts government benefits like retirement and disability insurance benefits (mainly Social Security), medical benefits (mainly Medicare and Medicaid), income maintenance benefits, unemployment insurance compensation, veterans’ benefits, and federal education and training assistance. The rate of growth of transfer receipts in DC was more in line with US metropolitan areas in the US, and less similar to the rates of growth in areas that are rural or suburban.
