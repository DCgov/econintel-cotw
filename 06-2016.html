<h3>Thought DC residents were a bunch of humanities majors? Turns out DC is STEM-heavy (no, really!)</h3>

We often hear that the DC area is among the best-educated in the country, with a high concentration of college-educated residents and graduate degree-ho lders. According to a recent data-rich report from DC-based incubator and seed fund 1776 called <a href="http://www.1776.vc/reports/innovation-that-matters-2016/" target="_blank">Innovation that Matters</a>*, among major US cities, the DC region also has the highest proportion of more <i>recent</i> graduates. It was the only region in the study where over 8% of the population were aged 25-34 and had a college degree. 

Yet DC is not at the top of all of the report’s measures; in terms of total startups the Bay Area, New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle outpace DC (though New York and LA have larger populations). There has been some speculation that this may be because the college grads in DC have different degrees than college grads in other cities, for example fewer STEM graduates and more humanities majors.

The answer when we look at the District of Columbia in American Community Survey data, is that such speculation does not match the data. The District actually has a higher proportion of bachelors degree-holders in science and engineering fields, but fewer in business, than the US as a whole – and many other large cities. And this is particularly true for the millenial cohort of the working population, residents aged 25-39. Among that age group, DC actually leads other major US cities for the proportion of 4-year degree-holders who graduated in scientific fields.
