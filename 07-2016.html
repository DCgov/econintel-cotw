<h3>The difference two years makes to income distribution in DC</h3>
 
We analyzed 2011 and 2013 (the most recent year available) adjusted gross income data from the IRS. Even over this short time period, there were notable changes in the household income distribution in DC. While this dataset cannot say whether the changes were caused by households moving into, out of, or within DC, or whether income distribution shifts occurred because of rising incomes, it does highlight some interesting trends.

Certain zip codes saw large changes even over this short period. For example, zip code 20001, which had a total of 23,890 filers in 2013 (an increase of 8.8% overall), saw a <b>45.1%</b> increase in total tax filers making $200,000 or more (from 882 to 1,280), a <b>18.1%</b> increase in those making between $100,000-$200,000 (from 3,023 to 3,570), and a <b>23.8%</b> increase in those making between $75,000-100,000 (from 2,060 to 2,550). Still, its largest class of filer were in the $1-$25,000 range (6,735 in 2011 and 6,560 in 2013). Zip code 20001 is in the middle of the city and includes parts of the Bloomingdale, Chinatown, East End, Mount Vernon Triangle, and Shaw neighborhoods.

The IRS data includes returns from single filers, joint filers, and head of household filers. For privacy reasons, 2013 data from the IRS dataset was rounded to the nearest 10, but was not in the 2011 version of the data. The dataset does not include tax returns with an adjusted gross deficit.

<h3>Guest post: Resident Employment in D.C. is Growing Faster than in the D.C. Suburbs and U.S.</h3>

<i>Stephen Swaim <br> DC Office of Revenue Analysis, Office of the Chief Financial Officer | Contributor to <a href="https://districtmeasured.com/" target="_blank">District, Measured</a></i>
 
Since the summer of 2014, the number of residents who are employed has been growing at a rate that’s about two to four times higher in D.C. than in the city’s suburbs. About 20 percent of the increase in D.C.’s resident employment appears to be from more unemployed people working, but this doesn’t account for most of D.C.’s faster growth rate compared to the suburbs. The faster growth rate is primarily due to population growth.  New residents either moved to the city for a job in the region or were already employed in the region and moved into D.C. proper.
