<h3>Guest post: Resident Employment in D.C. is Growing Faster than in the D.C. Suburbs and U.S.</h3>

Since the summer of 2014, the number of residents who are employed has been growing at a rate that’s about two to four times higher in D.C. than in the city’s suburbs. About 20 percent of the increase in D.C.’s resident employment appears to be from more unemployed people working, but this doesn’t account for most of D.C.’s faster growth rate compared to the suburbs. The faster growth rate is primarily due to population growth.  New residents either moved to the city for a job in the region or were already employed in the region and moved into D.C. proper.
